## Introduction
This repository holds a basic implimentation of the Phong shading model in gdscript. To run this program, open the project in godot and run the main scene or run the main scene directly through command line.

## Core
I implimented basic user controls and setup the project with the Stanford Bunny.

## Completion
Started my Phong lighting model and exposed various fields to the user interface. I am using a directional light.

## Challenge
For the challenge, I implimented a offset to the y value of each vertex using trig functions and the globally exposed time variable to create a distortion effect. While relativly simple to impliment, paired with a dither or a pulse, this effect can be used to add flavor :P
