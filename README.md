## Introduction
This repository holds a basic implimentation of the Phong shading model in gdscript. To run this program, open the project in godot and run the main scene or run the main scene directly through command line.

## Core
I implimented basic user controls and setup the project with the Stanford Bunny. The user controls are read and used to set the instance properties of the referenced bunny every frame.

## Completion
Started my Phong lighting model and exposed various fields to the user interface. I am using a directional light.

## Challenge
For the challenge, I implimented a offset to the y value of each vertex using trig functions and the globally exposed time variable to create a animated distortion effect. While relativly simple to impliment, paired with a dither or a pulse, this effect can be used to add flavor to an unstable object.

## Extra
I felt like I needed to add a bit more so I created some simple controlls for rotating the model using the arrow keys and rotation the light by using the arrow keys and shift. Its not my best rotation work but I don't have the time to do the quaternion math for this project.
